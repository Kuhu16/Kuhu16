The management team of Atliqo Telecom Company noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. Atliqo’s business director requested their analytics team to:

Provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch in Atliqo,
Convey insights to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics,
Suggest recommendations to optimize their internet plans to get more active users.
Key metrics used
In order to track KPIs’ performance pre vs. post 5G launch, we will focus on measuring: average revenue, average ARPU (Average Revenue per User), total active users, total unsubscribed users, market share percentage, total market value and plan revenue.

The questions below form the basis for my analysis.

How were the overall revenue, ARPU, active users, and unsubscribed users before and after 5G implementation? Did it show a significant upward or downward trend?
How were the change % of revenue, ARPU, active users, and unsubscribed users per city pre vs. post 5G launch?
How much does Atliqo contribute to the market share percentage before vs. after 5G implementation?
How much total market value does Atliqo generate per month, and also pre vs. post 5G launch?
How did revenue growth compare before vs. after 5G implementation? and which plan’s revenue generated the most and the least revenue pre and post 5G launch?
