 I'm delighted to showcase my first Codebasics Power BI resume project that I've just completed. In this challenge, our task was to craft a dynamic dashboard for the Revenue Management team at Atliq Grand Hotel to provide key insights to the revenue team. I have used Power Query Editor for data cleaning and calculated various measures for better analysis.

‚û° Business terms:

Occupancy % - Occupancy refers to the total successful bookings compared to the total rooms available (capacity).
Cancellation % - Calculating the cancellation percentage.
ADR (Average Daily Rate) - It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period. ADR = Room Revenue / no. of rooms sold.
RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Rooms) - RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue-generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands.
Realization % - It is the successful "checked out" percentage over all bookings made.
DBRN (Daily Booked Rooms Nights) - This metric tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period.
DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) - This metric tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.
DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights) - This metric tells on average how many rooms are successfully utilized by customers for a day considering a time period.
No Show rate % - Calculating the no-show percentage. ("No show" refers to those customers who neither canceled nor attended their booked rooms).
